# To-Do-List-Console-
This is a simple to-do list that will allow the user to create, delete, and manipulate tasks.

As of now(12/7/2024), the to-do list application has the following features:
1. Lets you create tasks.
2. Lets you view tasks (if at least one already exists).
3. Lets you mark the task as completed (if at least one already exists). Example of a completed task: "[X] This task has been completed".
4. Lets you delete a task or all of them (if at least one already exists).
5. Lets you delete completed tasks.
6. Goes back to the main menu when you enter 0 (in enter task mode, delete task mode, and mark as completed mode).

Here are a few cons/future improvements of the applicaiton:
1. You can enter only one task at a time.
2. When you choose to delete the completed tasks, the application will say that marked tasks have been completed even if there are no completed tasks in the file.
